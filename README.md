# ![logo](ng-irc.png) Angular in IRC

> Compilation of Angular-related resources from the IRC ##angular channel on freenode.

## A few suggestions getting help

> When you join the channel, don't ask to ask: just ask the question and be patient waiting for the answer.

> If the question is complex, it would be better providing a minimal working StackBlitz (template link in the topic).

## The Rules

1. `Don't ask to ask`.
2. `It doesn't work` is not an issue, because `here it works`.
3. `Why` can be explained. `How` can be googled.
4. `StackBlitz` is always worth it.

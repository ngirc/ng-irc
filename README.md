# ![logo](ng-irc.png) Angular in IRC

> Compilation of Angular-related resources from the IRC #angularjs channel.

## A few suggestions getting help

> When you join the channel, don't ask to ask: just ask the question and be patient waiting for the answer.

> If the question is complex, it would be better providing a minimal working plunker.

## The Rules

1. Don't ask to ask.
2. &quot;It doesn't work&quot; is not an issue.
3. &quot;Why&quot; can be explained. &quot;How&quot; can be googled.
4. A Plunker is always worth it.

# ng-irc
Compilation of Angular-related resources from the IRC #angularjs channel.

Root folder contains the content for the entry point: http://ngirc.js.org/.

`docs` folder contains the contents for Read the Docs: https://ng-irc.readthedocs.io.

Read the Docs configuration is defined in the file `mkdocs.yml`.

Due to a webhook (see settings), Read the Docs pages are automatically built when new content is pushed to `docs` folder.
